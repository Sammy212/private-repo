# Repository Access Disclaimer

## Private Repository

Thank you for your interest in reviewing my work.

Unfortunately, I am unable to share the source code directly. This repository contains the core code for a LIVE project actively in use by an existing business. Due to confidentiality and ethical considerations, I am not at liberty to make the code publicly accessible.

I completely understand the importance of evaluating candidates' work, and I would be more than happy to provide:

- A detailed verbal walkthrough of the project architecture, development process, and key technical decisions.
- Insights into the technologies used, challenges encountered, and how those challenges were resolved.
- Examples of similar projects I have worked on or code samples from other repositories that I can share.
